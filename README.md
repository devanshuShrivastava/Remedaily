## INTRODUCTION

Remedaily is an Android application which helps to remind users of their daily (weekly, monthly) intake of medicines. This application is mostly targeted at an elderly audience with a focus on accessibility and usability. The user will be able to enter their medical information and prescriptions and the  pplication will send a push notification when it is time for the user to take their inputted medication. We have kept in mind the common isolation of senior citizens while creating Remedaily.

### *PURPOSE*
The purpose of the application is to serve as a medication administration reminder. The primary audience is the aged people (55+) and the secondary audience is whoever who wants to be notified of a medicine intake according to schedule.

### *SCOPE*
Remedaily is an android application that helps to remind users of their daily intake of medicines. This application is mostly targeted at an elderly audience with a focus on accessibility and usability. The users will be able to enter their medical information and prescriptions and the application will send a push notification when it is time for the user to take their inputted medicine. The primary audience for the application is senior citizens and the secondary audience can be anyone that wants to be reminded about their medications. The application has been designed in such a way that it would be easy to use since the majority of the users will be older people. Thus, this application will act as an assistant that helps the users to remember medication times. The users will also be able to enter personal and prescription details in the application. The users will be reminded of their medications through sound, vibration and even flashlight. The main benefit of using this application is that the users will not need to track times for taking regularly scheduled medicines.        
 
We have designed our application with keeping in mind the scalability. Hence, we are going to release it on android play store as beta version soon.

### *ENVIRONMENT*
The Remedaily application can be efficiently used in an environment which is calm and noise-free. The noise free environment would allow the users of the application to hear all of the medicine notifications of the application. The interface will be calm and free of clutter to allow the users of the applications to easily see the medicines on the screen. The main environment where the application can be used are homes, hospitals, and at any place which calm and noise-free.

### *MEDIUM*
The primary medium for using the application is mobile phones, but currently it has been designed just to be used on mobile phones and not on tablets and wearable devices. If in future, the app gets a good recognition and user-base, then we would implement the app for other types of devices as well. The app has been designed only for the Android smartphone users. The other operating system users would not be able to use this app. The app would use the flashlight and different ringtones to notify the user about the medication. The app is also implemented with an email feature, so that an email can be sent to their family members in the case where the users forget to take their medications.

### *MODE*
The application has been designed for users which are seated on chair or sofa, relaxing at their home, or on-the-go. As Long as the user has their medication on them, which they should, they will be able to use the applciation effectively. If the user’s state of mind is busy, bored or angry, then such users will not enjoy the application. This application is expected to be used when the user receives a notification about their medication, when the user wants to enter medication information, or when they would like to see when they need to administer their next medication.

### *SWOT ANALYSIS*
**Strengths**
- Accessible design
- No interenet required
- Advanced notification system

**Weaknesses**
- Medical industries are slow to adapt to new technologies so external support for our application may not be available
- Android only
- Requires user input

**Opportunities**
- Recommendations from medical industry

**Threats**
- Variable user-base
- Similar applciations exist

## Discussion
In this section, we will discuss what all the technologies that can be used to implement the application.

### *TOOLS*
Android Studio. Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development. It is available for download on Windows, macOS and Linux based operating systems. We have used this IDE as per university requirements.
 
Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source-code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. For our project, we have used GITLAB.


### *MODEL-VIEW-CONTROLLER (MVC)*
Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. Each of these components is built to handle specific development aspects of an application. MVC is one of the most frequently used industry-standard web development frameworks to create scalable and extensible projects.
 
We developed Remedaily’s modules keeping in mind that we don’t violate MVC framework. As you can see in the above fig, we have modularized our code and optimized it.

### *TESTING*
>“Testing is an infinite process of comparing the invisible to the ambiguous in order to avoid the unthinkable happening to the anonymous.”* 
-James Bach[1].

Testing provides developers a gain in confidence on the modules developed and ease in maintaining them. In our project, we have divided the testing into three modules- Unit Testing, Integration Testing, and System Testing. Unit testing was done before the compilation of the unit modules with the main project. Integration Testing was performed after every time the modules were integrated. System Testing provided us the assurance that our application is ready to be merged in the Master branch.

#### *Unit Testing*
It was the first level of software testing where the developers tested their components after the development. The purpose kept for this testing was to validate that each module performs as designed. We developed several test cases for each unit. The individual units were java classes, functions, xml modules and database modules. The unit test cases are displayed below.
